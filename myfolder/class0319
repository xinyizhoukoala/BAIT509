Bagging is a special case of random forests under which case?
--- Bagging is a special case of a random forest when m = p. 
    Therefore, the randomForest() function can be used to perform both random forests and bagging

What are the hyperparameters we can control for random forests?
--- Number of trees in the foreset, max number of features considered for splitting a node,
    max number of levels in each decision tree, method for sampling data points (with or without replacement)

Suppose you have the following paired data of (x,y): (1,2), (1,5), (2,0). Which of the following are valid bootstrapped data sets? Why/why not?
(1,0), (1,2), (1,5)
(1,2), (2,0)
(1,2), (1,2), (1,5)
--- The first one is not valid, but the latter two data sets are valid. Becasuse for the first option, (1,0) is not in the original data set.

For each of the above valid bootstapped data sets, which observations are out-of-bag (OOB)?
--- for the 2nd data set: the OOB observation is (1,5)
    for the 3rd data set: the OOB observation is (2,0)

You make a random forest consisting of four trees. You obtain a new observation of predictors, and would like to predict the response. 
What would your prediction be in the following cases?
Regression: your trees make the following four predictions: 1,1,3,3.
Classification: your trees make the following four predictions: “A”, “A”, “B”, “C”.
--- As for the regression model, I choose the average to be my prediction - that will be 2
--- As for the classification model, I use the most frequnent votes as my prediction - that will be A
